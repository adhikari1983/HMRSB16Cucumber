For every screen/page in the application, we create a separate class for it and keep all the
locators/WebElements of this page in this class and we create a key of locators which we will
pass in every step

page initialization concept from java

The Page Object Model (POM) is a design pattern used in software development for creating automation tests.
It is primarily employed in test automation frameworks, such as Selenium, to enhance the maintainability
and re-usability of test scripts.

The main idea behind the Page Object Model is to represent each web page or user interface (UI) element as a
separate class, referred to as a "Page Object." These Page Objects encapsulate the various functionalities
and interactions of the corresponding web page or UI element. By doing so, the test scripts can interact with
the application's UI through these Page Objects instead of directly interacting with the HTML elements.

The benefits of using the Page Object Model include:

Modularity: Each web page or UI element is represented by a separate class, allowing for better organization
and modular design of the automation code.

Re-usability: Page Objects can be reused across multiple test cases, reducing duplication of code and improving
maintainability.

Easy maintenance: When the UI changes, updates only need to be made in the corresponding Page Object, rather
than modifying every test script.

Improved readability: Test scripts become more readable and self-explanatory as the interaction with UI elements
is abstracted into methods and properties within the Page Objects.

Collaboration: Testers and developers can work together more efficiently by using the same set of Page Objects
as a common interface between testing and development teams.

Overall, the Page Object Model design pattern promotes a structured and maintainable approach to automation
testing, making it easier to develop and maintain robust automated tests for web applications.
